		<p>
			The goal of VendorDB is to provide you with all the information you need for safely shopping in the space of Research Chemicals.
			<br /><br />
			We will always stay completely independent. We provide information to you, not advertisement to vendors.
			<br><br>
			Currently, the site is still under heavy development. Expect a constant influx of new stuff!
			<br><br>
			Additionally, the entirety of VendorDB is <a href="https://github.com/VendorDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Free&Open-Source</a>!

	<div class="section">
		<h1 class="title">We live through your donations!</h1>
		<p>
			The operation of VendorDB is entirely donation-based. There are no ads, fees, premium
			memberships, or similar. <br />
			If you like what we do and want to help keep VendorDB up and running, feel free to contribute on
